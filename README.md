Assessment 2 Project Code

Project Set-up Instructions
===========================

1. Clone the repository.  It helps.  Don't worry about your project files overwriting any other files, Git has been configured to ignore these.  If you're using the GitHub tools, also install good old fashioned Git as it integrated with both Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA to make managing version control easier.
2. If you will be using eclipse, set your workspace to be the repository root.  You should also install the Gradle IDE from http://dist.springsource.com/snapshot/TOOLS/gradle/nightly.  You may also find the Git plug-in useful if it is not already installed.
3. In Eclipse go to File -> Import -> Gradle -> Gradle Project.  Choose the taxe folder in the repo and then press Build Model.  You should import both Core and Desktop, the taxe project is just a necessary wrapper and will never be used for anything.  Click Import and wait patiently.
4. In JetBrans IntelliJ IDEA, good luck... You'll need it.  I keep getting an error that I can't get rid of no matter how many environment variables I set.
